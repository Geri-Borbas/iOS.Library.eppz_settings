 Handy class to encapsulate saving / archiving of object properties, typical

 Enable iCloud Key-Value store, and iCloud Documents in application capabilities.
 
 May define default values by include a @p <key>.plist in the bundle with the default
 values for each property. See more at https://github.com/eppz/iOS.Library.eppz_settings
